# ShellCheck Configuration File
# This file configures shellcheck linting rules for the project

# Disable specific warnings that are acceptable for this project
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location.
# SC1091: Not following: (error message here)
# SC2001: See if you can use ${variable//search/replace} instead.
# SC2004: $/${} is unnecessary on arithmetic variables.
# SC2006: Use $(..) instead of legacy `..`.
# SC2015: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true.
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes, use double quotes for that.
# SC2028: echo won't expand escape sequences. Consider printf.
# SC2034: foo appears unused. Verify it or export it.
# SC2046: Quote this to prevent word splitting.
# SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string. Use printf "..%s.." "$foo".
# SC2064: Use single quotes, otherwise this expands now rather than when signalled.
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.
# SC2115: Use "${var:?}" to ensure this never expands to / .
# SC2120: foo references arguments, but none are ever passed.
# SC2124: Assigning an array to a string! Assign as array, or use * instead of @ to concatenate.
# SC2128: Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element.
# SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects.
# SC2140: Word is of the form "A"B"C" (B indicated). Did you mean "ABC" or "A\"B\"C"?
# SC2148: Tips depend on target shell and yours is unknown. Add a shebang or a 'shell' directive.
# SC2154: var is referenced but not assigned.
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values.
# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes.
# SC2164: Use cd ... || exit in case cd fails.
# SC2166: Prefer [ p ] && [ q ] as [ p -a q ] is not well defined.
# SC2170: Don't use -e to test for non-empty directory, use -d to test for directory.
# SC2174: When used with -p, -m only applies to the deepest directory.
# SC2181: Check exit code directly with e.g. 'if mycmd;', not indirectly with $?.
# SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting/globbing, or split robustly with mapfile or read -a.
# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output (or quote to avoid splitting).
# SC2219: Instead of 'let expr', prefer (( expr )) .
# SC2220: This may not be portable. Use 'printf %s\\n' or 'printf %s\\x00'.
# SC2221: This word is outside of quotes. Consider quoting it.
# SC2222: Use "${var:?}" to ensure this never expands to / .
# SC2223: This default assignment may cause DoS due to globbing. Quote it.
